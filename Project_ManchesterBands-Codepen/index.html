      <blockquote>
        <p>"If it stopped banging on about its football teams and its bands and its shops and its attitude,Manchester
          has something that it can be genuinely, enormously proud of, something it should shout from the rooftops.<br>
          Manchester changed the world's politics: vegetarianism to feminism to trade unionism to communism, every
          upstart notion that ever got ideas above its station, every snotty street-fighter of a radicial philosophy,
          was fostered brawling in Manchester's streets, mills, pubs, churches and debating halls."</p>
